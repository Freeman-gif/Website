# Computer Vision main


---
### Main:
[[CNN]]



---

### Def:
- process understand visual data
- visual processing starts with simple structure
- 





#### visual data:
- 

#### how visual is physically formed:

#### neural network, convolutional neural network: 

---
### Process:
input image -> Primal sketch -> 2 1/2 -d sketch -> 3-D model


- Input image:
	- Perceived intensities
- Primal Sketch
	- Zero, crossings, blobs, edges, bars
- 2 1/2 -d sketch
	- Local surface orientation
- 3D model representation
	- 3-D models hierarchically organized

### Recognize and Represent objects

**goal**:
reduce the complex of the complex structure of the object into a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">collection</mark> and their geometric configuration 

**Method**: 

- generalized Cylinder

- Pictorial Structure 
**Object recognition**

### image classification:
**Image segmentation** or **semantic segmentation** is the task of assigning a class to each pixel in an image. Models are trained using segmentation maps as target variable. z
