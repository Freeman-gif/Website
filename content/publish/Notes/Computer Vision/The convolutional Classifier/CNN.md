### Notes and Ideas:
#### Convolutional base:
- Used to **Extract the features ** from an image. it is formed primarily of layers performing the convolution operation.
#### Dense Head:
- The head is used to **determine the class** of image. it is formed primarily of dense layer, but might include other layers like dropout.
#### visual features:
- A feature could be a line, a color, a shape, a pattern -- or some complicated combination

#### training the Calssifier
The goal of the network during training is to learn:
1. which features to extract from an image (base)
2. which class goes with what features 

#### Transfer learning
reusing a pretrained  model
