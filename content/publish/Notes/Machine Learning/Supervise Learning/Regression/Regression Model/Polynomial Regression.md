# Polynomial Regression


---
### Notes and Ideas:
- We are using polynomial geatures to capture nonlinear effects
- Capture high order features of data by adding polynomial features
	- Using to capture the [[nonlinear]] effects
- Can also include varaible interactions:
	- $y_\beta(x) = \beta_0 +\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2  + \beta_3x_1x_2$

- How is the coreect functional from chosen:
	- Check relationship of each variable or with outcome

- Problem Fixing:
	- [[Prediction]]
	- [[interpretation]]
- Polynomial Regression could apply to examine several models:
	- [[Logistic Regression]]
	- [[K-Nearest Neighbors]]
	- [[Decision Trees]]'
	- [[Support Vector Machines]]
	- [[Random Forests]]
	- [[Ensemble Methods]]
	- [[Deep Learning Approaches]]
