# Model Validation & Diagnosis Main


---
### Main:
- [[Inference on the regression parameters]]
- [[Examine through plots]]
- [[Testing]]
- [[Multicollinearity]]
- [[Diagnose for out lier detcetion]]

Diagnosis :
Detection:
-   [[Outliers]]
-   [[Multicollinearity]]

**For predictor X**:
1. Dot plot
2. Stem and Leaft plot
3. Box Plot
4. Sequence Plot(if the observations are time ordered

**Diagnostics for  Residulas($e_{i}$):** [[Residulas]]

**Violation of Assumptions:**
1. Regression funciton is [[non-Linear]]
2. Non-cosntant variance
3. Error terms not independent
4. Possibility of [[Outliers]]
5. None Normal Distribution of errors
6. Omissiion of some of the important predictors

### Key :
1. Avoid the variance of the response value is a linear function
	1. we would not know if the relation is from mean or vairance(we should see varaince as a constant for the varaince of the resposne value)
	2. it's a free for all problem
