# MSE


---
### Notes and Ideas:

**Defination**:
- Statistic:
	- The mean squared error of an estimator meausures the ==average== of the squares of the errors, the average squared difference betweem the estimated values and the actual value. it;s a [[Risk Fucntion]], Corresponding to the [[expected value]] of the [[squared error loss]]. the MSE is almost always strictly posivtive(and no zero) is becaue of randomness or becasue the estimator ==does not account for information that coould produce a more accurate estimate==
- Machine Learning:
	- Sepcifically [[Empirical Risk Minimization]]
	- MSE may refer to the [[Emprical Risk]], as an estimate of the true MSE(the true risk: the average loss on the ==actual population distribution== )
