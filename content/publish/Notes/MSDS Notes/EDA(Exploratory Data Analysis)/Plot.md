### Notes and Ideas:

- Histogram
	- ![[Pasted image 20230713102619.png]]
	- Frequency distribution
	- on the y is either frequency of proportion
	- x would be a column of the data
	- x would be the input to the histogram
	- only take on column and taking the distribution of the column
	- note:
		- only use it for numerical data
		- distribution of one numerical column
- Bar Plot
	- ![[Pasted image 20230713103129.png]]
	- input x - > categorical column
	- input y-> summarized numerical statistic aggregated by x
- Pi Chart

	- Take the numerical data that represent the categorical value 
		- x: categorical column
		- y: numerical measure for each slice 
		- good for limited categorical choice
- Heat map

	- matrix like plot
- Tree map
	- ![[Pasted image 20230713104958.png]]
- scatter plot
	- ![[Pasted image 20230713105229.png]]
	- x and y 
	- each dot is the pair location of (x,y), 2 input
	- both X and Y need to be numerical 
- Line plot
	-  ![[Pasted image 20230713105732.png]]
	- both need to be numerical
	- it show the trend of the x and y changes 
- Boxplit:
	- 1 input: X numerical
	- summary data
