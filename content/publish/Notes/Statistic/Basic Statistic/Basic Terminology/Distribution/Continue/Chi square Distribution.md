# Chi square Distribution


---
### Definition 
let $z_{1},\dots,z_{n}$ be iid N(0,1). Then $X^2=Z_{1}^2+\dots+z_{n}^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with **n** degrees of freedom
**Note**:
If there are some [[linear constraints]] upon z's like:
$$z_{1}+\dots z_{n}=a(\text{some constant})$$
then the degrees of freedom **Decrease by the number of constraints in the model**
