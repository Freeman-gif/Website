# Normal Distribution


---
### Definition 



---

### Pdf & CDF:
PDF: $$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} 
  \exp\left( -\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{\!2}\,\right)$$

#### Variance & Expected Value



---
#### Distribution plot


---
#### Regression:
if $y^{*}=a+bY$ follows a NOmral distribution with $E(y^{*}=a+b\mu)$ and $Var(y^{*})=b^2\sigma$

ACtually this also holds true if Y asymptotically follows a Normal distribution by a result called the [[Mann-Wald theorem]].

A normal distribution with mean 0 and varaiance 1 is called the **Standard Nomal distribution**
