# moment Generating Function

---
## Notes and Ideas:
The expected values E(X),E(X2),E(X3),â€¦,and E(Xr) are called moments.
since we know that $$\mu = E(x)$$ and $$\sigma^2=Var(X)=E(X^2)-\mu^2$$
Which are functioons of moments, are someimtes difficult to find.
We use moment-generating function to find moments and functions of moments, such as $\mu^2 $    and     $\sigma^2$



Let X be a duscrete radom varaible with probability mass function f(x) and support S, then:

$$

M_x(t)=E[e^{tx}]=\sum_{e \in  s}\limits e^{tx}f(x)


$$
