**Lemma**:
Consider a collection of random variables$X_0,X_1,....$ Interpret $X_n$ as the State of the system at time n, and suppose that the set of possible values of the $X_n$--that is, the possible states of the system is the set 1,.....N. if there exists a set of bumber $P_{ij},i,j = 1$$,.....N, such that whenever the process is in state i then,
