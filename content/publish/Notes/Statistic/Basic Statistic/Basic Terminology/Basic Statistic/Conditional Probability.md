## Conditional Probability
----

**Defination**:

Conditional Probability of an Event A given *the condition B has happen* :

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$

Apply with probability measure theory:
![[Event & Probability Measure Function]]



$P(A \cap B) = P(B)P(A|B)$

if A and B are independent 

$P(A|B) = P(A)$

$P(A \cap b )= P(A)P(B)$

**Example**:
we have 10 yellow ball, 8 red ball, 7 green ball. Draw twice *Without Replacement* if the 1st is yellow, what's the probability of 2nd is also yellow 
$$=P(2ndY|1stY)$$
$$=\frac{P{2stY}\cap P 1stY}{1stY}$$
P(TTH) = P(T)P(T)P(H)
