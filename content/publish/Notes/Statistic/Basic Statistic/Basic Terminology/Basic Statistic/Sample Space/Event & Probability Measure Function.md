Probability Measure Function

$$S \to{R}$$


$P(A)$ = $\frac {\#favorbale \,  outcomes}{\# possible\,outcomes}$

----
$P(A_{i})$ is a probability measure function if it statistic:
- $P(A) \ge 0$ for all A $\in$ S
- $P(S) =1$
- if $A_{1},A_{2}\dots.$ are mutually exclusive

---
**Theorm**:
1. For any event A, $P(A) =1 - P(A)'$
2. P(empty) = 0
3. if $A\le B$ Then $P(A)\le P(B)$
4. for all A, $P(A)\le 1$
5. $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)-P(A\cap B)$
6. $S = \cup^{n}_{i=1} S_{i}$, Then $P(S_{i})=\frac{1}{n}$

example:

flip a coin twice, we would have 4 possible out comes: {HH,TT,HT,TH}, say if we looking for outcome is TH, then the probability is : 
$$\frac {1}{4}$$
