**Defination**:
A random variable X is called a [[Continuous Random Variables]] if there is a function f(x), called the [[Probability density funciton]] of X, such that the CDf can be represented as 
$$F(x)=\int f(t)dt$$


$P(A) = \frac{Area \space in \space a}{Area \space in \space  \Omega}$

$\Omega$ = $\bigcup_nC_n$
