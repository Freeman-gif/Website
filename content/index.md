Hello!
```

I'm Freeman, and you've just entered my digital realm, a space I fondly refer to as my "Second Brain" on the Internet.

At present, I'm navigating the intricate world of Data Science as a graduate student at the University of San Francisco. Parallel to my studies, I'm gaining practical experience in the same field, working part-time at the Buck Research Institute. My focus there lies in the fascinating area of computer vision, specifically cell segmentation - a blend of technology and biology that captivates my curiosity daily.

# A Single Place for All Data Knowledge
Welcome to the my second Brain, a one-stop-shop for data-related concepts. Inspired by the Digital Garden analogy, this interactive platform offers a comprehensive collection of data terms, covering various topics.Happy
# Project I have worked

[[Alcohol Consumption]]
[[Basketball Shooting With Regression]]
[[Spokane Hospital Data Analysis]]
[[Microsoft Capstone Project]]
# Navigation
There are multiple ways to navigate my Second Brain:
