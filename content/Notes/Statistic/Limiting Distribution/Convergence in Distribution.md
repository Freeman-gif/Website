# Convergence in Distribution


---
### Main:
---
Definition:
	1. If $Y_{n}$ ~ $G_{y}$ for each n = 1,2,..., and it for some CDF G(y)
		$$\lim_{ n \to \infty } G_{n}(y)=G(y) $$
	for all values y at which G(y) is continues, then the sequenece $Y_{1},Y_{2},\dots$ is asid to **converge in distributuion** to $Y$ ~ $G(y)$, denoted by $Y_{n} \to^{d}Y$. The distribution corresponding to the CDF $G(y)$ is called the limiting distribution of $Y_{n}$
