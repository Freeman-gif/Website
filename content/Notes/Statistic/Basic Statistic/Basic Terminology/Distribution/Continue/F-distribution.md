# F-distribution


---
### Definition 

Let $\chi^{2}_{1}(v)\text{and}\chi^{2}_{2}(v)$ follow [[Independent]] [[Chi square Distribution]] with $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ degrees of freedom then: 

$$F = \frac{\frac{\chi_{1}^2(v_{1})}{v_{1}}}{\frac{\chi_{2}^2(v_{1})}{v_{2}}}$$ follows a F distribution with $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ degrees of freedom
