# Uniform Distribution


---
### Definition 
Let X be the outcome when a point is selected at random from [a, b] and the chance of each point getting picked is the same.

$x~unifo[a,b]$ a and b are parameters 


---

### Pdf & CDF:
$$

f(x) = \int_{0}^{x}

$$

$f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}$


$P(x\lt a)=F(a)$
$P(x\gt b) = 1-F(b)$
$P(a\le x\le b)= F(b)-F(a)$
