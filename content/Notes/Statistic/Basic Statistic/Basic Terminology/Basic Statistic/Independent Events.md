# Independent Events


---
### Def:
- Independent Events is for event from the same random experiment ($A\in S$, $B \in S$)(Example: the face of dice is independent)
- The current of ocurance of one event doesn't change the chance of orcurance of the other events.
- We said $A$ and $B$ are independent, $iff$ :$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)*P(B)$$ $$\implies P(A|B)=P(A)$$

### vs Mutually Exclusive
$P(A\cap B)=P(A)*P(B)$ - independent
$P(A\cap B)= 0$ - mutually exclusive

if  mutually exclusive events is independent iff one events is 0
