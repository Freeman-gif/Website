Multiplication Rule:
- if we have an experiment with $n_1$ possible outcomes, such that for each outcome of the first experiment, there are $n_2$ outcome for the second experiment, for each outcome of the $n_r$ outcomes for rth experiment, then overall, there are $n_1*n_2*...n_r$     overall possible outcomes. 
- examplie of the coin toss
