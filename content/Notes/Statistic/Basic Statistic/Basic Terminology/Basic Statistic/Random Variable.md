# Random Variable

### Defination:

($\Omega,A,P$)

$\chi$ is a function from $\Omega$ to a real value
$\chi:\Omega \rightarrow R$

$P_{X}(B)= P(X^{-1}(B)) = P(X \in B) = P(A)$
- Projecting the outcome to the space 
- $r.v$ X represents all the outcomes from an experiment 
- If outcomes in S are ==numerical==, then keep X how they are (roll dice : 1,2,3,4,5,6....)
- if outcomes are categorical, then we want to assign some numbers to the outcomes. (coding : encoding )
- Type of random variables (Data)
