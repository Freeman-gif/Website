# Correlation coefficient


---
### Defination:
==The Mearsrue pf the linear relationship between X and Y==
**$$Cov(X,Y)= \frac{\sum_{i=1}\limits}{{2}}$$**

==corvirance is unit dependent==
solution : we devide the standard diviation to standardize both X and Y.

Devide the standard diviation will constarin the correlation in -1 and 1
