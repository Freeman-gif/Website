[[Natural number]],[[intergers]],[[real numbers]],and [[complex numbers]] can be mainpulated using generic operations to generate new sets of numbers. In particular, we define the [[Euclidean product]] of two sets $A$ and $B$ as $$A \times B =(a,b)|a\in A \ {and} \ b\in B$$

We can take powers of set by writing
$$A^{n}=A\times A\times A \times.....\times A$$
This construction yield that will become our favorite set of numbers in the next few chapters:
$$R^{n}= (a_1,a_2,...,A_n:a_{i\in}R,  \forall i)$$
