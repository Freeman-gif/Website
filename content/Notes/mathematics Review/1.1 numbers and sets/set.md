# Perliminaries: number and sets

- [[Natural number]]
- [[intergers]]: 
- [[rational number]]
- [[real numbers]]
- [[complex numbers]]

${N,Z,Q,R}$

N,Z,Q,R, and C can be mainpulated using generic operations to generate new sts of numbers. In particular, we define the [[Euclidean product]] of two sets $A$ and $B$ as $$A \times B =(a,b)|a\in A \ {and} \ b\in B$$
