# Supervise Learning Guide


---
	Definition:
	Supervised learning models are a type of machine learning algorithm that involves training a model to predict an output based on input data, where the output is known for a set of labeled examples. Supervised learning is used in a variety of applications, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
	The choice of model depends on the problem at hand and the type of data available. It is important to evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test set to ensure that it generalizes well to new data. **Regularization techniques** can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model.
