### Notes and Ideas:
Definition 
- The problem where the X matrix is unstable 
- The Variance of $\beta$ are huge
- Do not efffect prediction
- It would effect the model itself
How to Deal with it:
	- Using of centered data for predictor varaibles when using polynomial regression and other regressions with interactions
	- Dropping one or more predictores
	- Add some cases that may break the pattern of multicollinearity
	- Use different data sets to estimate different 
	
vs outercorrelation
