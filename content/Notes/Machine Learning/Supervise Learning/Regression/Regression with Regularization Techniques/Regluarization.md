# Regluarization


---
### Notes and Ideas:
![[Addjusted cost function]]
Regluarization performs [[Feature Selection]] by shrinking the contribution of features.

For L1-regularization ([[Lasso Regression]]), this is accomplished by driving some coefficients to zero.

Reducing the number of features can prevent overfitting.
