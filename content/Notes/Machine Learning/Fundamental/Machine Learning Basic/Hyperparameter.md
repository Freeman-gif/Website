# Hyperparameter


---
### Notes and Ideas:
Hyperparameters are also variables that control how the model is training. Therefore, they can control the values of [[Parameters]]. In other words, the optimal values of parameters depend on the values of hyperparameters we use. Unlike parameters, hyperparameters do not learn their values from data. We need to manually specify them before training the model. Once specified, the hyperparameter values remain fixed during the model training process.
