# Parameters


---
### Notes and Ideas:
Parameters are variables that allow the model to learn the rules from the data. During the training process, they are updated by the algorithm. We do not set optimal values for the parameters. Instead, parameters learn their own values from data. However, in some cases, we need to initialize parameters with some relevant values in the beginning. Once the optimal values for the parameters are found, the model has finished its training. That model is suitable for making predictions on unseen data.
