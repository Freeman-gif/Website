---
#### How To Do EDA
- What are we looking for when we conducting EDA:
	- Patterns
		- Is there a relationship between X and Y
		- how's the relationship trending
		- what kind of distribution that would fit this dataset 
	- Spot anomalies
		- Unexpected data patterns

	- Find key performance metrics:
		- Is there a relationship between X and Y
