The [[Span]] of a [[set]]([[Bases]]) $S\subseteq V$ of vectors is the set:
$$S = a_1v_1+a_2v_2+...a_kv_k:v_{i}\in S\ {and}\ a_{i}\in R \ for\ all\ i$$

application example:

 

The typical well at a cocktail bar contains at least four ingre- dients at the bartenderâ€™s disposal: vodka, tequila, orange juice, and grenadine. Assuming we have this well, we can represent drinks as points in $R^4$, with one element for each in- gredient. For instance, a tequila sunrise can be represented using the point (0, 1.5, 6, 0.75), 

representing amounts of vodka, tequila, orange juice, and grenadine (in ounces), respec- tively.

The set of drinks that can be made with our well is contained in $$span{(1,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0),(0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,1)}$$,

that is, all combinations of the four basic ingredients. A bartender looking to save time, however, might notice that many drinks have the same orange juice-to-grenadine ratio and mix the bottles. The new simplified well may be easier for pouring but can make fundamentally fewer drinks:

$$span {(1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 6, 0.75)}$$.
