### Example for linear equation:
#### House Price = Intercept + Coefficient * Square Footage
### Example for non-linear equation:
#### Population Growth = A * Time^B
###### In both examples, linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between variables, while nonlinear regression introduces more complex equations that capture nonlinear patterns
