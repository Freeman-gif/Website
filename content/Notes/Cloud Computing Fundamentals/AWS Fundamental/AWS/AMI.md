# AMI


---
### Notes and Ideas:

let you configure which operating system you want, you can also select storage mappings, the architecture type (such as 32-bit, 64-bit, or 64-bit ARM), and additional software installed.


[[EC2]] instances are live instantiations of what is defined in an AMI, much like a cake is a live instantiation of a cake recipe.
