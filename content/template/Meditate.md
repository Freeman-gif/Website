# Reminder
## Making myself better, puts me in a position to make others better, be the example, not the problem. The best way take away the problem is to alienate yourself from it  
## Take time sit and think through. Before rush into the next phase when not ready. 
# Reflect and Realign

## I strive to improve myself every day; through this journey, I can guide and inspire others.
## In moments of haste, I will pause and center myself. Readiness of mind precedes all meaningful action
## My experiences in Montana remind me to engage with others from a place of wholeheartedness and fervor

### Think
1. What is my priority today? What truly matters?
2. What burdens am I carrying that I can release?
3. How will I embody my values today, and who will I be in the world?
4. 3 things I am grateful for?
